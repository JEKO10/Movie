## Project task

This a movie app that is written in React and created with Vite. The TMDP API powers the movies and their information. TypeScript has become irreplaceable in every form of my JavaScript usage. For styling my React components, I use Styled Components. I also used Eslint to ensure theÂ best syntax practices and cleaner code.  

## Project overview

I created a home page, discover (by genre and keyword) page, single movie, and single person page. I used express and MySQL database to store the user information on creating an account. Also, I added movie options: Mark as watched, like a movie, or add it to your watchlist. I made modals for writing a review, adding a movie to a list, and sharing it on social media or through a specific movie link.
