## Project task

This website is built with SASS/React-TypeScript and Redux-Toolkit. I used TMDB API to make a movie app. The user will be able to sign up, add reviews, make lists, add films to the watchlist, and search for movies.

## Project overview

I created 4 redux-toolkit slices so far. One for trending movies that gets data from TMDB API with axios. Second for trending people. And other 2 for getting single movie and person information.
