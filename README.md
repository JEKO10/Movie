## Project task

This a movie app that is written in React and created with Vite. The TMDP API powers the movies and their information. TypeScript has become irreplaceable in every form of my JavaScript usage. For styling my React components, I use Styled Components. I also used Eslint to ensure theÂ best syntax practices and cleaner code.  

## Project overview


I created home page, discover (by genre and keyword) page, single movie, and single person page. I plan to use express to connect react with database so user can stay signed in and see other profiles.
