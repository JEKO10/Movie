## Project Task

This is a movie app built with React and created using Vite. It utilizes the TMDP API to fetch movie data and information. TypeScript has been instrumental in enhancing the reliability and scalability of the JavaScript codebase. Styled Components has been employed for styling React components, while Eslint ensures adherence to best syntax practices and maintains clean code.

## Project Overview

The project includes a home page, discover page (by genre and keyword), single movie page, and single person page. Future plans involve integrating Express to connect React with a database, enabling user authentication and profile viewing functionality.
