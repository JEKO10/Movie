## Project task

This is my first time working with context as app providing method, and I think it is a great solution. I used Omdbapi API to make a movie recommendations app.

## Project overview

The home page displays a search bar, for searching movies by name, and results for browsing godfather. You can search and learn more about a lot of movies. It displays basic info like the director's name, the year it was published, runtime, etc. I used fetch and promises to get API data.
